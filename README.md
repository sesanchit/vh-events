# vh-events

A personal project as part of a HackerRank test.
Some restraints were: no images, no libraries and a single HTML, CSS, JS file.

Hosted here: https://vh-events.netlify.app/

Just, a simple dummy application.
An attempt to make a single page application with no frameworks / libraries.
Out of curiosity, I just wanted to make HTML templates purely with JS itself 😀
Also, no CSS frameworks as well.

Just, the magic of HTML/CSS/JS ❤

And, I wanted to make a splash screen. OMG, it takes me back to older times. Feels like making screens with WPF. 😁
