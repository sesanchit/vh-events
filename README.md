# vh-events

A personal project as part of a HackerRank test.
Hosted here: https://vh-events.netlify.app/

An attempt to make a single page application with no frameworks / libraries.
Out of curiosity, I just wanted to make HTML templates purely with JS itself 😀
Also, no CSS frameworks as well.

Just, the magic of HTML/CSS/JS ❤

Some restraints were: no images, no libraries and a single HTML, CSS, JS file.
